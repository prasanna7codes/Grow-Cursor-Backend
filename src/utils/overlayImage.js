 * not an optimisation: this module must return an image list that is entirely
 * EPS-hosted or entirely untouched, and never a blend of the two.

 * pictures change while the item stays live, so anything eBay fails to fetch
 * leaves the old product's photos on a listing that now describes a new one.
 *
 * Uses the same PLAIN_BADGE route the secondary images already take, so these
 * share the OverlayImage cache and the all-or-nothing failure rule with every
 * other hosted picture rather than growing a second set of semantics.

 * Pictures are hosted at PREVIEW time, but a CSV is uploaded to eBay whenever

 * file re-used months on. EPS reclaims any picture no live listing has claimed,
 * and eBay removed the only call that could extend that deadline
 * (ExtendSiteHostedPictures, decommissioned July 2025). So the deadline cannot
 * be pushed out; the pictures have to be replaced instead.
 *
 * Each cache row is a complete recipe for its own picture — source URL, badge,
 * placement, seller — so a stale URL can be rebuilt without re-scraping Amazon
 * or asking the caller for anything it does not already have.
 *
 * ALL OR NOTHING, as everywhere else in this module: a list where some pictures
 * were refreshed and others could not be is exactly the mixed-host state eBay
 * rejects with 20004. If any picture cannot be rebuilt, the original list is

/**
 * Bring a list of pictures under one seller's account, re-hosting whatever is
 * not already there and still valid.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * A CSV holds literal URLs, so a file exported for seller A and uploaded under
 * seller B leaves B's listing pointing at pictures hosted in A's account. eBay
 * ties a picture's lifetime to the listing using it, so when A's listing ends,
 * B's images are dropped with it — and if A's account is ever suspended, B's
 * listings lose their pictures outright. The cache key includes sellerId
 * precisely to stop composites being shared this way; copying a CSV by hand
 * walks around that, and this puts it back.
 *
 * Runs at feed-upload time, the last moment before the file reaches eBay, so
 * it also catches pictures that simply expired while the file sat unused. Both
 * problems have the same remedy — re-host under the seller doing the upload —
 * so they are handled in one pass rather than two.
 *
 * Unlike the rest of this module there is no all-or-nothing rule here: the
 * uniformity eBay enforces is EPS-vs-external, and every outcome of this
 * function is still EPS. A picture that cannot be rebuilt is left pointing
 * where it did, which is exactly as good as not having run.
